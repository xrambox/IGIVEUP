      Woven City is a project developed by Toyota, which began its construction in 2021. The project is still in its early stages, and the first phase of construction was completed in 2023. This initial phase laid the groundwork for the city‚Äôs infrastructure, including roads, utilities, and basic facilities.

      The city began accepting its first residents in early 2024 as part of a pilot program with around 100 residents. These initial residents are key to testing and refining the technologies integrated into the city, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and AI-driven systems. The population is expected to grow gradually, with a projected total population of approximately 2,000 residents in the coming years as more phases of the city‚Äôs development are completed.

       Woven City is designed as a living laboratory where technology, sustainability, and urban innovation can be tested in real-world conditions. The city will continue evolving over time, integrating new technologies and expanding its facilities.
